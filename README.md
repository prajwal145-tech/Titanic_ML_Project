# Titanic Dataset â€“ Data Cleaning, EDA & Survival Insights  

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the **Titanic dataset** using Python. It focuses on **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **visualization** to uncover key survival patterns based on passenger demographics and ticket classes.  

---

## Project Overview  

In this project, I:
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns).
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**.
- Visualized survival patterns across **gender, passenger class, age, and fare**.
- Derived actionable insights about survival factors and laid the groundwork for predictive modeling.

## Key Insights  

- Out of 891 passengers, **549 did not survive**.
- **Men had a much higher mortality rate** compared to women, indicating that women (and likely children) were prioritized for rescue.
- **1st class ticket holders had the highest survival rate**, followed by 3rd class, while **2nd class had the lowest survival rate**.
- **Passengers around age 30**, especially those holding higher-class tickets, showed a greater likelihood of survival.
